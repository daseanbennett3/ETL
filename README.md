# TITLE: Extracting, Loading, & Transforming Sales Data
# DESCRIPTION:
In this project I found an interesting data set on Kaggle.com that I wanted to further investigate. The data had information on different orders that a company had received during the years of 2022 and 2023. The Orders table contains information on the shipping date, the product ordered, the date order, ect.
I started this project using python code in Jupyter Notebook to download the dataset from kaggle.com. The python code I used can be found in my "" file. 
I extracted the Orders.CSV file from the zip file.
I made some edits/cleaned up the data by adding and deleting necessary and useless columns, respectively.
After cleaning the data, I then connected to a SQL Server datatabse and uploaed the newly transformed data to Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio. 
From there I ran queries to answer some posible questions that a viewer might have.
The questions and their respective answers can be found in my "QUESTIONS-&-ANSWERS.sql" file.
