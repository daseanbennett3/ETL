# TITLE: Extracting, Loading, & Transforming Sales Data
# DESCRIPTION:
In this project I found an interesting data set on Kaggle.com that I wanted to further investigate. The data had information on different orders that a company had received during the years of 2022 and 2023. The Orders table has information on the shipping date, the product ordered, the date, ect. I initially used python code in Jupyter Notebook to doen the dataset from kaggle.com and then I extarcted the zip file. I made some edits to the file such as adding and deleteing necessary and useless columns respectively. After cleaning the data I connected to a SQL Server daattabse and uploaed the newly transformed data to it.
